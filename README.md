# Pyterrier_GenerativeQR

Implementation of the Generative Query Reformulation approach devised by Wang et. al. in Generative Query Reformulation for Effective Adhoc Search. Current implementation has been tested with google/flant5-xxl to generate query reformulations however any model (following the structure shown in models.py) can be used with the transformer class itself.
